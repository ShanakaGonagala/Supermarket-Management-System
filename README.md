# Supermarket Management System
 
This is a Java-based Supermarket Management System developed using Java Swing for the user interface and MySQL for the database. It was created as a 2nd-year project to demonstrate a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with role-based access control. The system allows admins and cashiers to log in with different permissions, managing the supermarket's operations efficiently.

## Features

### Admin Features:
- **Login**: Secure login functionality for admins.
- **Employee Management**: Admins can add, update, or delete employee details.
- **Inventory Management**: Admins can add, update, or delete products from the inventory.
  
### Cashier Features:
- **Login**: Cashiers have their own login portal.
- **Billing**: Cashiers can create new bills during sales, which automatically updates the product inventory in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: For building the application's frontend using Java Swing.
- **MySQL**: For backend database management, storing product, employee, and sales information.
- **Eclipse**: IDE used for development.
